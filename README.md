### Overview
This project applys Data analysis skills to help to find a solution for Microsoft to implement in their new venture of creating movies and making a movie studio alongside.

## Business Understanding
Microsoft lacks prior knowledge in film making so by analysing the movie market and studying it to see trends and understand this new venture will be advantageous to Microsoft as they won;#'t be diving into deep waters without knowing.

## Data Understanding
For this analysis we are making use of data collected from:
 * https://www.imdb.com/
 * https://www.boxofficemojo.com/
 * https://www.rottentomatoes.com/
 * https://www.themoviedb.org/
 * https://www.the-numbers.com/
 
 We will focus on 3 datasets when doing this analysis
 
 ### 1) TMDB DATA
 This dataset contains information about a movie, clearly indicating the language it was produced in.
 It's popularity among audiences based on a vote
 And the release date of this movie
 
 ### 2) IMDb Data
 This set of data contains more information about a movie such as:
  * Details of the Movie's directors, writers and actors
  * Information about The characters in the movie
  * The movies's genre, region, language, average rating, run time in minutes and original title of the movie
  For our analyis we'll major on the movie's rating and genre

 ### 3) The Numbers
 This contains details of a movie's production budget and how much the movie grossed both locally in the US and worldwide

## Data Cleaning
In our data cleaning process we will majorly be focusing on the following issues:
 * Missing Values
 * Duplicate values
 * Data types for entries


After carrying out the above cleaning we are now able to use our data to generate an analysis of the movie production business.

## Results

The above visual shows the distribution of movies in various Genres. From our analysis we found out that Drama and Documentary are two of the most popular genres even based of average rating.

We then did a scatter plot to see the relationship between a movie's production budget and the Total Gross both locally and worldwide.
There is a positive linear relationship between the two whereby if a movie's production is high then definetly the chances of a higher gross earnings is strong

Next we did an analysis of the most popular Languages to originally produce a movie in.We had English having most movies thus having another plot excluding English so as to see where the other languages lie.

Our second analysis based on language was now to focus on a movie's language popularity based on the audience votes. We gathered the top languages with high average ratings are Japanese, French, Chinese, Hindi then English

## Recommendations
After gaining insights from our analysis, it is now safe to say that Microsoft may use this analysis in their new venture and mainly focus and implement the following:
 * Produce a movie in either the *Drama Genre* or *Documentary Genre* since they are the most popular amongst the various audiences
 * Microsoft should also invest well in a movie's production to ensure good returns in terms of gross earnings. A production budget of about $350,000,000 has shown to be the best ingredient to cook a total gross earning of a billion dollars.
 * Finally in terms of what language is the most suitable, we discovered that most studios produce English movies and when you take a look at the consumers point of view movies' in English, Japanese and French seem to have a high average popularity with them.
