### Overview
This project applys Data analysis skills to help to find a solution for Microsoft to implement in their new venture of creating movies and making a movie studio alongside.

## Business Understanding
Microsoft lacks prior knowledge in film making so by analysing the movie market and studying it to see trends and understand this new venture will be advantageous to Microsoft as they won;#'t be diving into deep waters without knowing.

## Data Understanding
For this analysis we are making use of data collected from:
 * https://www.imdb.com/
 * https://www.boxofficemojo.com/
 * https://www.rottentomatoes.com/
 * https://www.themoviedb.org/
 * https://www.the-numbers.com/
 
 We will focus on 3 datasets when doing this analysis
 
 ### 1) TMDB DATA
 This dataset contains information about a movie, clearly indicating the language it was produced in.
 It's popularity among audiences based on a vote
 And the release date of this movie
 
 ### 2) IMDb Data
 This set of data contains more information about a movie such as:
  * Details of the Movie's directors, writers and actors
  * Information about The characters in the movie
  * The movies's genre, region, language, average rating, run time in minutes and original title of the movie
  For our analyis we'll major on the movie's rating and genre

 ### 3) The Numbers
 This contains details of a movie's production budget and how much the movie grossed both locally in the US and worldwide

## Data Cleaning
In our data cleaning process we will majorly be focusing on the following issues:
 * Missing Values
 * Duplicate values
 * Data types for entries


After carrying out the above cleaning we are now able to use our data to generate an analysis of the movie production business.
